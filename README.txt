Project Structure:
ev_charger_simulator/
├── main.py                 # Main entry point
├── ocpp_enums.py          # OCPP enumerations
├── configuration_keys.py   # Configuration management
├── meter_values.py        # Meter values handling
├── message_handlers.py    # OCPP message handlers
├── ev_charger_simulator.py # Core simulator logic
├── gui_dialogs.py         # GUI dialog windows
└── gui_main.py            # Main GUI application
To Run the Simulator:

Make sure you have the required dependencies:

bashpip install websockets

Run the main file:

bashpython main.py
Benefits of This Structure:

Modularity: Each file has a specific purpose, making it easier to maintain and update
Smaller Files: No more huge files that need complete regeneration for small changes
Separation of Concerns:

OCPP protocol logic is separate from GUI
Configuration management is isolated
Meter values handling has its own module


Easy to Extend: You can add new message handlers or features without touching other files
Better for Version Control: Changes are isolated to specific modules

How It Works:

main.py is the entry point that creates the GUI
gui_main.py creates the main window and handles user interactions
ev_charger_simulator.py contains the core OCPP logic
configuration_keys.py manages all OCPP configuration keys
meter_values.py handles meter value generation and transmission
message_handlers.py processes incoming OCPP messages
gui_dialogs.py contains popup dialogs for configuration

Now when you need to make changes, you only need to update the specific module instead of regenerating everything!
